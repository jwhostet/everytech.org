I decided on Pelican as my choice of site generator. It is easy to use and relatively easy to setup. I was tired of keeping the whole web server stack up to date and therefore didn't write much. This site refresh means I lose my secure site but ultimately allows for higher availability and speedier access. Hopefully I will continue to add things to my fancy little site and make it look prettier. I have been working more with Solaris, 3D printing, owning and mainting a house, all sorts of things that I could be adding to my site.&lt;/p&gt;

hobbies. I have to work on a logo, making this site have less WordPress
branding all over and more awesomeness. Thanks for your interest and I
will be getting this site up as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
