encryption is mainly for logging in to the blog a few other things. I
kind of want to install EtherPad... that will be a different day, maybe
when I bump the Virtual Machine specs or move to bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sadder note just yesterday morning the world lost another great
man. He started the business I work for and has made it a great place to
work. His passing away reminds me of a very good friend of mine who
recently passed away along with my grandfather. We will never forget
what the have done in the time they have been with us. From the smiles
to the heartfelt caring we will always remember.&lt;/p&gt;
