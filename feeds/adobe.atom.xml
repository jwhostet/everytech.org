Adobe's AEM/CQ software. The class was alright, I learned a few things.
Every class I take I understand a bit more about how it will integrate
into our setting. The unfortunate thing is I still don't see the big
picture. On the subject of the class if you don't know anything about
AEM/CQ it will definitely inform you and teach you all about the
authoring side of it. I would suggest it for those who have not touched
AEM/CQ before for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I now have a monitoring system set up for my web server and
also analytic software set up to help track visitors. I don't plan on a
lot of visitors but the project itself still is pretty nifty. I am still
working on what I'm going to do for a logo and maybe more customizing of
the site. For now I will hopefully be able to start posting more!&lt;/p&gt;

The class was
very interesting and while I did have to leave early, it was still very
worth the trip. The documentation which came in the form of a hard to
read PDF (low DPI) is the most important part. The instructor was great
but you canâ€™t take him with you. Not going to get too in depth about the
class now as I hope to complete more of my blog. I hope to be making it
a little more secure and adding in a few more pieces and parts.&lt;/p&gt;
